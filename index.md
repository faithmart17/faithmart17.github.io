# Faith Martinezâ€™s CPSC 120 Portfolio

I am a computer science student at Cal State Fullerton and expect to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs:

* Lab 1
     Even though this is the very first lab, I find it sentimental. I recently did a major change and this was my very first lab so this one is very sentimental to me. This lab was so simple but so fascinating. 

* Lab 3
      I really enjoyed this lab because of my partner. My partner had helped me a lot with this lab because I was struggling to understand what the directions were. He explained the instructions perfectly and we went through the lab very easily. 

* Lab 6
      I also really enjoyed lab six because of how fun it was to write it. We had to code a madlibs game with sandwiches. It was really challenging but fun!
